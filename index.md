## fMRI for little babies
Are you a researcher, a scientist new to fMRI, or simply someone looking to learn a little bit more about neuroimaging? Well look no further because you are in the right place! 
In my time as a researcher I have found myself in quite an interesting predicament... There seems to be a wealth of information about fMRI in the vast reaches of the internet, but a lot of it is either:

- Extremely involved
- Has a lot of words but does not quite answer what I need
- Is "simple" but honestly even then sometimes I get lost

I decided to start this website to help others who, like me, are thirsty for that data but get lost in all the confusing jargon. 
Before I get deep into to I wanted to share some resources that have been helpful in my quest through voxel laden lands:

- [Dr. Mumford's incredible list of resources including her youtube channel, which has saved many a struggling neuroscientist](https://jeanettemumford.org/)
- [Dr. Jahn who like Dr. Mumford, is among the fMRI legends gracious enough to share their infinite wisdom among us lowly worms](https://www.andysbrainblog.com/)

This is just a place to get started... Hope you stick around for more!
